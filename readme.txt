Turn your WooCommerce store into a simple online catalog or alternatively, only allow store access to customers once they're logged in.

== Description ==

Simple Catalog for WooCommerce turns your WooCommerce store into a simple online catalog site.

WooCommerce is a fantastic eCommerce plugin, but sometimes you might only want to showcase your products rather than sell them. This plugin allows you to use the power of WooCommerce to manage all your products whilst hiding the eCommerce functionality like the Add to Cart Buttons, Prices, Ratings and the Cart & Checkout pages from your customers.

Later on, when you decide you're ready to sell your products online, simply disable this plugin and all your WooCommerce functionality will return.

Using this plugin you're able to restrict the eCommerce functionality to all your customers, or just to customers who haven't logged in.

When hiding your prices, product ratings and Add to Cart buttons, you're able to hide them completely or just hide them from users who haven't logged in. You also have the option of showing a message to your customers in place of your price.

For use with WooCommerce 2.6 and above.
